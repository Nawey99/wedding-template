									<h3>Getting Closer</h3>
									<p>
									<h2>Jos</h2>
									Since we both were part of a common friend group, I always knew her as the one who
									was closer to most of our friends. So, I was determined to learn more about this
									charming girl. Little did I know, I was about to start a journey that would change
									everything! As we started hanging out more, I found myself venting about my life to
									her. She became my go-to person for advice, laughs, and the occasional complaints.
									But you know what? I kept telling myself she was just a friendüòÅ. Or at least,
									that‚Äôs what I thought! üíñ
									</p>
									<p>
									<h2>Gift</h2>
									For me, it was one of those things where sometimes people just get on your nerves.
									That was true for us in the beginning!
									<span class="more-text hidden" id="more-text">
										I found him a bit‚Ä¶ overwhelming, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs so special about him?' I often
										wondered, when everyone fussed over him. And don't get me started on his PC ·äê·ãâ,
										·à∞·àã·àù·â≥ üôÑ But my curiosity got the better of me, I decided to dig a little deeper,
										observe his interactions with others, noticing his genuine care for everyone in
										our circle. As I got to know him better, I realized how much he loves God and
										has a heart of service‚Äîin church and in life.

									<h3>Becoming each others favorite</h3>
									<p>
									<h2>Jos</h2>
									The more I talked to her, the more I was drawn to her kind, wise, and patient
									nature. She was the most understanding person I‚Äôd ever met, caring deeply without
									judgment, even when I made mistakes. That‚Äôs when I knew she was the partner I had
									always wished for, and I fell in love with her. She reminded me of the Proverbs 31
									woman‚Äîstrong, wise, and full of good values.
									</p>
									<p>
									<h2>Gift</h2>
									I began to appreciate his humor; it showed me that he genuinely cares about
									everyone's feelings and wants them to feel comfortable and included.
									<span class="more-text hidden" id="more-text">
										He quickly became one of my favorite people, making me laugh, charming me with
										his voice and touching my heart with his kindness. Likewise I started turning to
										him for guidance, amazed by the way he saw things from a different perspective!
										I started to really respect his advice and even his simple thoughts.! If you
										spend some time with Jos, you never get tired of his conversation.
										<br>P.S - And let‚Äôs not forget how he dresses‚ÄîAlways with class! üòâ!
										Spoiler alert: That‚Äôs when I realized how much I was falling for him. üòç
										</p>
										<p>
										<h2>Jos</h2>
										Being in love felt wonderful. It was like stepping into something beautiful,
										full of hope and excitement. But just as we began to embrace that feeling, life
										threw a twist our way. I was always looking for opportunities to grow and found
										a chance to study abroad. The timing felt uncertain‚Äîhow could we know for sure
										where this connection would lead with the distance ahead of us?
										But love? Oh, it has its own way of making things work when God's will be
										covering it. Through late-night video calls and sharing our daily adventures,
										our bond grew even stronger. Slowly but surely, we both knew we wanted to spend
										forever together. <br>
										<br>
										We shared countless laughs and adventures, and even though we had our fair share
										of ups and downs, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è those moments only strengthened our bond. Yes, we had
										some fights that made us question if we could even be friends. At some point we
										even went our separate ways and focused on our own lives, but then‚ÄîGod in His
										own time, drew us into each other! üôè He changed our hearts, rewrote our story
										according to His plan and He led us back to each other. Isn‚Äôt it amazing how God
										can change people and situations? This time around, we were happier than ever!

									<h3>The Proposal! üíç‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
									<p>
									<h2>Jos</h2>
									One day, after seeing a friend's proposal picture, I thought it was the perfect
									moment to ask her what kind of proposal she‚Äôd dream of. She told me exactly what she
									wanted. Now, my mission was to figure out her ring size without her knowing. Huge
									thanks to Leni and best friend/sister Dureti, who helped me crack the code...Phew,
									that was quite a challenge!
									<br> <br>
									We had a photoshootüì∏ planned
									<span class="more-text hidden" id="more-text">
										to announce we were dating, and I decided to make it the perfect opportunity.
										With Leni and the photographer on board, we set everything up. We were extra
										careful. If you know Gifti, she kinda has a sixth sense‚Äîshe‚Äôs very observant,
										which makes it hard to surprise her.
										<br>
										I was so nervous, trying to act cool during the shoot. Then, in the middle of
										it, I suddenly dropped to one knee and asked, "Will you be the love of my life?"
										She was shocked, staring at me for a few seconds while my heart raced. Finally,
										she said, "Yes!" I was over the moon, thrilled to be marrying the most beautiful
										girl, inside and out. Best day ever!

									<h2>Gift</h2>
									When the proposal moment came, I wasn't expecting it to happen then, but it turned
									out to be exactly how I wanted. What I thought would be a simple day to announce our
									relationship to friends turned into something extraordinary.
									<span class="more-text hidden" id="more-text">
										Suddenly, Jos dropped to one knee and proposed! It was a complete surprise; I
										never expected it would happen that day.
										<br>
										The moment felt perfect for us, full of excitement and surprise, surrounded by
										laughter and happy tears. <br>
										As I looked into his eyes, I realized that this was just the beginning of our
										greatest adventure. With every heartbeat and every shared smile, we knew we were
										starting a journey that would redefine everything we thought we knew about
										love.‚Äù

									<h2>Jos</h2>
									‚ÄúBeing the last child in my family, my family was excited to send elders to Gift‚Äôs
									home to officially request to become one family ‚Äú·àç·åÉ·âΩ·àÅ·äï ·àà·àç·åÉ·âΩ·äï‚Äù. I was so happy
									<span class="more-text hidden" id="more-text"> I got to be represented by these
										elders who are close to my family. They met up, had a good discussion, and
										figured out the best way to convince Gift‚Äôs family to say "YES." Then, they went
										over, and made the request,
										The elders came back with the most incredible news: a resounding "YES!" Mission
										Accomplished!! They shared how warmly and respectfully they were welcomed and
										treated like angels by Gift‚Äôs family. It filled my heart with gratitude and
										excitement to see this beautiful chapter begin, blessed by our family‚Äôs
										involvement and joined with such a kind and wonderful family.‚Äù</span>

									<h2>Gift</h2>
									·àΩ·àù·åç·àç·äì in our times is a show of respect between families. After all, he proposed,
									and I said yes, but his family formally asking mine demonstrates respect and serves
									as an icebreaker for the two families. And Jo's family did it right. True to the
									Shewa Oromo culture, they brought Siinqee, Coqorsaa, and gifts for my mom and
									grandma. Cool Fact: If there is a Sinke in a certain house for a certain girl, it is
									a show of engagement, and no other man can ask for her hand.
									(Sorry guys, am taken ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üòÜ)
									<span class="more-text hidden" id="more-text"> Even though my family interrogated
										them in the typical Shimgilina fashion, they didn‚Äôt ask them to return a second
										time‚Äîa gesture of appreciation for honoring the cultural expectations. Jo's good
										reputation as a God-fearing family loving man also played a part. My parents
										finally said yes‚Äîofficially accepting him into the family.
										It was a beautiful ceremony, and it was beautiful to see our families join our
										journey on such a positive note. I believe this will have a lasting impact on
										our marriage. After all, as the saying goes, 'Our wedding, their
										marriage.'</span>

									<h3>His Grace-Our Love story</h3>
									<p>
										As you read our story, we hope you can see that it‚Äôs not just another love
										story. Yes, it may seem like the usual journey every couple goes through. You
										might find it interesting, or you might just move on but for us, there is
										something much deeper. This story is here to testify that God is faithful. We
										are here today not because of our own strength, but because of God‚Äôs amazing
										grace. There were times when it seemed impossible, when life tested us in ways
										we never imagined. Yet, through it all, God never left us.

										God alone performed the miracles in our relationship and life. We are here today
										because of His faithfulness, and we want to glorify Him. He made a way when
										there was no way. It‚Äôs only because of His grace and love that we are united
										today.
										<br><br>
										As you read this, we ask you to join us in praising God for the miracle he has
										done in our lives and celebrate His amazing work in our journey.
